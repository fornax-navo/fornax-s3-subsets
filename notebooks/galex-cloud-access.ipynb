    "The Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) is a NASA mission that observed between July 7, 2003 and February 7, 2012 with the goal of investigating star formation evolution in galaxies from the early Universe to present day. With a 1.25 degree field-of-view, the telescope took direct images in the near-UV (NUV) and far-UV (FUV) wavelengths using microchannel plate detectors, and low resolution spectroscopy was obtained using a grism. Data was collected as time-tagged photon events and science data was only taken while behind Earth’s shadow (referred to as an “eclipse”).\n",
